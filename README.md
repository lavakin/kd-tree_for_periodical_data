# KD tree for periodical data
Project made for https://blackbox.ibt.biocev.org/devel/conformers_cif.php?cifcode=1hmh for Institute of Biotechnology of the Czech Academy of Sciences.

The implementation enables a fast search of nearest neighbours for a dataset of vectors of degrees. Preparation of the data is computationally demanding, but is necessary only when the dataset is modifies. Building the tree and searching in it is fast.
